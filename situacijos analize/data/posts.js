    text: "If you googled \"event-driven architecture\", I bet you'd find hundreds of detailed articles. Most of these articles would tell you how sending event messages between services enables asynchronous communication, makes components loosely coupled, allows them to be scaled easier, and even kisses you goodnight. If it sounds too good to be true, that's most likely because I've made up the last one. Sorry, where was I? Oh yes, as good as it sounds, having only event messages is not always enough. Using them too much (or abusing them) may result in bloated messages, unclear intent, or impossible-to-understand data flows. If it sounds too familiar or you'd rather avoid all of this, chances are you'd benefit from introducing different types of messages in your message-driven systems.",

    text: 'Building software applications for global audiences is a challenging task. One of the critical aspects that software engineers have to consider is making these applications speak different languages. A widely used approach is to use translated resource files. However, for those cases where you need to make translations more dynamic, moving them to a database might be a good alternative. There are multiple ways of building multilingual relational databases. Yet, one must understand both the approaches and the tradeoffs before starting.',
